			<h1 class="uppercase">Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile click</h1>
			<p class="author">By Greg Kot</p>
			<p>The setting was solemn, even breathtaking—the high ceiling and stained glass windows of Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on the University of Chicago campus. But the performers couldn’t have been more casual, even downright shaggy. Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile looked like twins, so much so that it was difficult to tell sometimes where one tousled head of hair or guitar part ended and the other began.</p>

			<p>The synchronicity flashed intermittently Thursday at the beginning of a three-night Chicago residency for the two artists, both guitar maestros: Barnett, an Australian indie-rocker who released an acclaimed 2015 debut album, “Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit,” and Vile, a Philadelphia songwriter who has released a string of solo albums after a tenure in the War on Drugs.</p>



			<p>The duo’s recent album, “Lotta Sea Lice,” is an utterly charming and at times galvanizing collaboration notable for the understated ease of the conversation between their voices and guitars. That dialogue was abetted by a fine but somewhat superfluous backing band at Rockefeller Chapel that included Sleater-Kinney’s brilliant drummer, Janet Weiss.</p>

			<p>Boomy acoustics in the room sometimes swallowed the dynamics when the five-piece band was in rock mode, and it took a few songs for the set to center itself. On “Continental Breakfast,” the undulating guitars suited the give-and-take between the singers, who traded sly quips and little knowing details about one of their early meetings. The lyrics made the seemingly mundane glimmer with possibility, and their guitars curled around each other and wafted away like cigarette smoke.</p>




			<p>On “Out of the Woodwork,” Vile leaned into the dark slope of one of Barnett’s songs, but his unhurried drawl suggested that things were going to work out if we all just chill a bit and not worry so much. For “On Script,” Barnett built a lullaby cadence into a slow-burn guitar interlude, as she and Vile blurred the roles of lead and rhythm.</p>

			<p>The band flexed some muscle on Barnett’s “Depreston” and “Avant Gardener” and Vile’s “Life Like This” and “Pretty Pimpin’,” but a mushy mix muted the impact. Instead, the most persuasive moments were the sparest, particularly when Barnett’s plaintive voice burrowed into the aching contours of Gillian Welch’s “Elvis Presley Blues” while Vile’s guitar provided empathetic commentary.</p>

			<p>Even better was the duo’s reading of Belly’s “Untogether,” an underappreciated song by a band that most people probably haven’t thought about in two decades. Over a sad organ drone, Weiss’ lonesome tambourine and the “Dead Flowers” strum of their guitars, Vile and Barnett melded their voices in hard acceptance of that which they can’t change, much less save. It was a rare moment where song, performance and the venue’s cavernous reverb aligned perfectly.</p>
