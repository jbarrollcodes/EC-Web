			<h1 class="uppercase">Trevor Noah at the Chicago Theatre: a fun break from the 'Daily' grind</h1>
			<p class="author">by Author tk</p>

			<p>Is there a young comedian out there (aside from Aziz Ansari, maybe) who has less to prove at the moment than Trevor Noah?
			Well, on stage at least. After taking over Comedy Central’s venerated “The Daily Show” in September of last year from longtime host (and near-infallible fake news demigod) Jon Stewart, the South African-born Noah certainly has much more than his share of proving to do both behind the interview desk and in finding his footing while skewering the daily news cycle.</p>

			<p>But regardless of what anyone thinks of his relative short tenure as a late-night TV host—not being Jon Stewart already rubs many people the wrong way, with viewership down below a million viewers a night, whereas Stewart was regularly drawing around 2.5 million—Noah’s presence and skill as a stand-up comedian are undeniable.</p>

			<p>On Saturday night, dressed entirely in black and pacing back and forth across the stage of the Chicago Theatre in his slightly avian manner, the 32-year-old Noah snuck up on punchlines with a twinkle in his eye and one of the most winning grins in show business.</p>

			<p>Like Ansari, he seems like a genuinely cheerful, likable guy who just happens to be incredibly driven. How else to explain a stand-up appearance in Chicago for back-to-back shows only six months into his “Daily Show” tenure? Perhaps this is Noah’s version of a vacation, alleviating the pressure from the Comedy Central suits to get those ratings up by returning to a place he feels more at home: alone on a stage with a microphone.</p>

			<p>Nick Kroll and John Mulaney keep laughs, tuna rolling in 'Oh, Hello'
			Opener Angelo Lozada—who also serves as the warm-up comedian for “The Daily Show” (“I’ve been doing this for 20 years and it took a man from Africa to give me my big break!” he semi-jokes)—gave a winning 30 minutes of affably scatter-shot comedy, complete with a surprising (and surprisingly effective) amount of crowd work. Lozada seemed so comfortable working such a large room it was almost as if the audience had accidentally come to see him, and would have (almost) been fine with that.</p>

			<p>But this audience came to get a look at Noah and his signature brand of charmingly direct anecdotes and in-depth socio-political commentary. Born in South Africa to a black mother and a white father during apartheid, Noah is able to address race from many different angles with candor and wonder alike. And his family history gives him more leeway to tackle topics that other comedians might avoid.</p>

			<p>“It must be hard in America for old, racist people,” he said with that signature twinkle, discussing how far we have come as a culture and how social progress inevitably leaves those accustomed to casual (and, often, institutionalized) racism wondering why they have to change. He then pointed out a curious aspect of American society: “People are more afraid of seeming racist than being racist.”</p>

			<p>Then came a good rule of thumb for deciding if something you’re about to say might be racist: “If you have to look around before you say it.”</p>

			<p>What followed was a clear-eyed examination of a few choice words—their origins, their meanings and how the intention behind a word is what hurts much more than the word itself. It was linguistic anthropology from a multi-linguist who revels in these kinds of discussions.</p>

			<p>What he notably didn't discuss was his very high-profile cable show. The Trevor Noah that talks up his discovery of tacos, driving on the “wrong” side of the road and confusion about the item of clothing known in America as the wife-beater seems to have only recently arrived in the USA, though Noah has been here for years at this point.</p>

			<p>Though funny, this material, presenting his life as an average guy, can seem dated given his well-known day (night?) job, but he struck a balance with fresh material specifically directed at his Chicago audience, describing the city as reminiscent of a movie set, with beautiful buildings, diverse people and a train running above ground, before hitting this one-liner: “You’ve even got the giant Trump building where the supervillain lives.”</p>

			<h4 class="uppercase">Good luck looking at that giant TRUMP nameplate in the same way ever again.</h4>

			<p>Still, despite the strength of his set and the confidence with which he delivered it—a deep, self-aware confidence that he has had from the beginning (watch the 2009 documentary “Trevor Noah: The Daywalker” to see an up-and-coming Noah preparing for his first special with the same self-assured grin)—it seemed odd that “The Daily Show” never came up. Surely there have been innumerable funny foibles and mind-blowing meetings that have happened to Noah on that set.</p>

			<p>If stand-up is truly his escape, though—a safe space he can control on his own outside of his host duties, where he must deal with the constant claims that he is not living up to the show’s legacy—why would he want to mention it? I predict there is much material building up from his experiences behind that desk that will be unleashed if the job ever slips away from him.</p>

			<p>But for now, an immediate standing ovation as a reward for putting out 70 minutes of solid, sunny solo work on a Saturday night in Chicago seems like the kind of energy a workaholic can take back to New York to help get him through another week of the daily grind.</p>
