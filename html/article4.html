			<p>In a rare moment of generosity, cosmetics pioneer Helena Rubinstein said of her arch-nemesis, Elizabeth Arden, “With her products and my packaging we could have ruled the world.” In fact, the two self-made colossi—one a Polish-Jewish immigrant with a rapacious appetite for art, jewelry, and real estate, and the other a dirt-poor Canadian farm girl with an insatiable hunger for racehorses and Wasp society—never met. But the inescapable fact of the other one’s existence goaded each of them on to greater and greedier glory. “The only Elizabeth stronger than I,” Arden proclaimed, “is the Queen.” Over the course of their epic careers, the rivals legitimated the use of cosmetics for respectable women, along the way perfecting such vanity-table staples as the lipstick tube and the mascara wand.</p>

			<p>Now the Tony-winning team from Grey Gardens—director Michael Greif, librettist Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel, lyricist Michael Korie—have resurrected the feuding makeup mavens for the musical War Paint, opening next month at the Nederlander Theatre and co-starring Broadway legends Patti LuPone, as Rubinstein, and Christine Ebersole, as Arden. “They had never worked together before,” Wright says. “None of us knew how the chemistry would react. But their affection keeps growing as their dastardly deeds onstage multiply.” LuPone notes, “There is not a person out there today who can compare to either of these women in their extravagance, their power, their business acumen, their excess.” One song, Ebersole says, raises the pertinent question of whether the duo “made women freer or helped enslave them.” But, for Rubinstein, such speculation was probably moot. “There are no ugly women,” she decreed. “Only lazy ones.”</p>
